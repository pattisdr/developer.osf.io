get:
  summary: List all preprint providers
  description: >-

    A paginated list of all preprint providers.
    The returned preprint providers are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent
    preprints appearing first.

    #### Returns

    JSON with `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 preprint providers.
    Each resource in the array is a separate preprint provider object.
    The `links` key contains JSON of links that can be used
    for [pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).


    This request should never return an error.

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include preprint providers that
    match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/preprint_providers/?filter[id]=osf.


    Preprint Providers may be filtered by their `id`, `name`,  and `description`


    #### Acceptable Subjects Structure
    
    Each preprint provider specifies acceptable subjects. 

    `subjects_acceptable` is an array found in `attribtues`. 

    Subjects consist of general parent subjects (e.g., Engineering), 
    more specific child subjects (e.g., Aerospace Engineering),
    and even more specific grandchild subjects (e.g., Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics).
    Subjects can only be nested 3 deep. 


        "subjects_acceptable": [
            [
                [
                    # Parent Subject:
                    # Architecture
                    "584240d954be81056ceca9e5",

                    # Child Subject: 
                    # Architectural Engineering
                    "584240da54be81056cecac87" 
                ],
                # Include all Architectural Engineering's children:
                true 
            ],
            [
                [
                    # Parent Subject:
                    # Engineering
                    "584240da54be81056cecaca9",

                    # Child Subject:
                    # Aerospace Engineering
                    "584240db54be81056cecacd6",

                    # Grandchild Subject:
                    # Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics
                    "584240da54be81056cecaa74"
                ],
                # All nestings 3 deep must be false
                false
            ]
        ]

    The above structure would allow Architecture, Architectural Engineering, all of Architectural Engineering's children,
    Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics.
