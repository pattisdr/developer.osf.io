    When a request fails for whatever reason, the OSF API will return an appropriate HTTP error code and include a
    descriptive error in the body of the response.  The response body will be an object with a key, `errors`, pointing
    to an array of error objects.  Generally, these error objects will consist of a `detail` key with a detailed error
    message and a `source` object that may contain a field `pointer` that is a [JSON
    Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the error-causing attribute. The `error` objects may include
    additional information in accordance with the [JSON-API error spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#error-objects).

    #Example: Error response from an incorrect create node request

        {
          "errors": [
            {
              "source": {
                "pointer": "/data/attributes/category"
              },
              "detail": "This field is required."
            },
            {
              "source": {
                "pointer": "/data/type"
              },
              "detail": "This field may not be null."
            },
            {
              "source": {
                "pointer": "/data/attributes/title"
              },
              "detail": "This field is required."
            }
          ]
