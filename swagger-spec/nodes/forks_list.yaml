post:
  summary: Create a fork of this node

    Creates a fork of the given node.


    TODO: explain what forks actually are... especially the difference between forks and templates


    Forks are complete copies of projects that you can change without affecting the original project.


    When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current node and components for which you are a contributor.
    Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.

    #### Required

    There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked node's attributes will be copied from the current node.


    The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current node's title.

    #### Returns

    Returns a dictionary with a `data` property containing the complete representation of the forked node, if the request is successful.

    If the request is unsuccessful, a dictionary with an `errors` property containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes]() to understand why this request may have failed.

get:
  summary: List all forks of this node
  description: >-

    A paginated list of the current node's forks.
    The returned fork nodes are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recently forked nodes appearing first.


    Forks are copies of projects that you can change without affecting the original project.

    #### Returns

    Returns JSON with a `data` and `links` property.


    The `data` property contains a list of up to 10 forked nodes.
    If the current node has zero forked nodes, the `data` property will contain an empty list.
    Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the forked node, meaning additional requests to the forked node's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` property contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).


    This request should never return an error.

    #### Filtering

    As forks are node objects, the same [filters that apply to nodes]() can be applied to forks.
